1. EKS Cluster
 Create EKS cluster.
 Note the VPC ID used (either create a new VPC or use an existing one).
 Note the private subnets in at least 2 AZs (for Aurora later).
 Ensure node security group is known (for allowing DB access).

2. Aurora Cluster
 Create a DB subnet group using at least two private subnets from the EKS VPC (different AZs).
 Select the same VPC as EKS.
 Choose instance type and number of replicas as needed.
 Assign a security group that allows PostgreSQL port 5432 from EKS node/pod SGs.
 (Optional) Enable automatic backups, monitoring, and encryption.

3. Connectivity
 Use the Aurora cluster endpoint in your EKS pods.
 PgBouncer sidecars connect to this endpoint.
 Verify connectivity from a test pod inside the EKS cluster.


âœ… Notes
No NAT or VPC peering is needed since Aurora and EKS share the same VPC.
Aurora requires multiple subnets in different AZs for high availability.
Security groups are the main thing controlling access.
